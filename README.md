* Using D3 to create animated visualization
  1. I was coding in JSBin which is very convenient to add libraries like D3, and will see the results immediately. (You's better uncheck auto run with JS, otherwise the webpage will froze for no reason)
  2. static.html is the one has a static effect, and my other code makes changes based on it to create different animations.
